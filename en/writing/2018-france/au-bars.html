                <h4>At the bar at night &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="date">10 Mar 2018 &nbsp; Paris</span></h4>
                
<br><br>
It is my first time to be alone at the bar at night since I started to live in Paris. I take a glass of vin chaud because I have a cold. Normally, I have a class with my Korean student on Saturday evening, but today, he got the time wrong, so we will meet tomorrow. 
<br><br>
Julie, a specialist of French literature, explained us during the last class what flâneur is according to Baudelaire. Flâneur observes people and draws their environment. 
<br><br>
Me, I was at the bar, and I think about the perception of a “temporal object” my professor said to me. Maybe, it was the subject that interests me as an artist. The rhythm of each person is different depending on his state and emotions. Therefore, we walk in different speeds. Each person has internal time. Indeed, we are temporal objects. Looking around me, I see some people walking, and their way of walking is the manifestation of their internal time. 
<br><br>
…
<br><br>
I feel bad. I talk to myself that I need to develop a project today. My head is heavy, but I cannot help thinking about my project...
