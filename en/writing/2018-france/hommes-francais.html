                <h4>French men &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="date">19 Feb 2018 &nbsp; Paris</span></h4>
                
<br><br>
                I like to listen to French men’s voice. It is interesting.
            <br><br>   I had a French boyfriend when I was in Korea. In those days, I was not interested in what he said in French because we communicated in English to know each other. This was enough for us.
            <br><br>             After our breakup, I started to study French because I had to find something to focus in order to forget my sadness. Every morning, before going to office, I went to cafe and studied French. It was my only happiness.
            <br><br>            One year after our breakup, we met each other again in Paris. At the bar, he asked a menu, and I listened his voice in French. I understood what he said. It was different from the tone he had with me. I discovered his new aspect. It was amusing to rediscover the man I had loved before. Maybe, I still loved him. 
            <br><br>             In my school in Paris, there are not many French men, and when I meet them, we speak in English. Nevertheless, I find French trace in their words and tones. “Dis-moi” is an example. This phrase “Dis-moi” procures a little joy in my tough life.
